# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct applies in all spaces managed by Elypia, including our repositories on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Elypia) and [GitHub](https://github.com/elypia), and any other communication used by our community.

## Guidelines

### Transparency

We value transparency and always aim to do things in the community-interest. It might be difficult to make _everyone_ happy, but we'll at least ensure public conversations take place before major decisions, and that everyone has a platform to raise their concerns.

### Inclusivity

We shouldn't gatekeep individuals out of projects, everyone's invited to participate. No one should be discriminated against solely based on [protected characteristics](https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights), level of knowledge, or political affiliation.

### Mature Content

Public communication should be considered safe for work. Bug reports, feature requests, or any other form of public communication shouldn't contain inappropriate media regardless of format without prompt notice and consent from whoever will receive it.

If it is necessary to share mature content, it must be done in a designated place, privately, or as a [confidential issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html) on GitLab.

## Reporting Problems

If you have problems with a participant of any of our projects, feel free to talk to us about it:

* Email us at [support@elypia.org](mailto:support@elypia.org).
* Email [Seth](https://github.com/SethFalco) directly at [seth@falco.fun](mailto:seth@falco.fun).
