## Guidelines

### License

All contributions must be released under the license of the project. For example, if a project is under the Apache 2.0 license, then the contribution must also be under the Apache 2.0 license.

Contributors don't have to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement). You're also welcome to denote your copyright in contributions, if you choose not to, you'll be covered by the generic "â€¦ and Contributors" terminology.

If you're making significant modifications to an existing file, you're encouraged to add your name and copyright to the license header at the top of the file. If creating new files, ensure you add the license header yourself with your name, and optionally a link or email address.

For example, the following notice should be added at the top of the file:

```
