# Don't Open Pull Requests on GitHub

Don't open pull requests against our GitHub repositories, they are mirrors only. Open pull requests on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Elypia) instead.

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) is part of the open-source community and can be self-hosted should the need ever arise.
