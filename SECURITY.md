# Security

If you've found a security vulnerability, please post an issue on our [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/Elypia/-/issues) repository and mark it as a [confidential issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/confidential_issues.html).

[GitLab](https://gitlab.com) is itself part of the open-source community and can be self-hosted should the need ever arise.
